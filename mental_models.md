# Mental Model Canvas

This canvas captures the **mental models** of each actor — how they *think the system works*, what they pay attention to, and why they behave the way they do today. This is not ideal-state thinking; this is *current reality*.

## 1. Learner Mental Model

**Core belief:**
> “Driving school is a black box. I just need to pay, follow instructions, and hope I pass.”

**How the learner thinks:**
* Learning driving = number of classes attended
* Instructor knows best; questioning feels risky
* Price = proxy for quality (but not reliable)
* License is the real goal, not skill mastery

**What the learner optimises for:**
* Finishing fast
* Avoiding embarrassment or shouting
* Not failing the test

**What confuses the learner:**
* What ‘ready’ actually means
* Why progress feels uneven
* Why extra payments appear late

**Resulting behaviour:**
* Accepts vague answers
* Worries silently
* Complains about price instead of process

## 2. Driving Instructor Mental Model

**Core belief:**
> “Every student is different, and the system doesn’t help me — experience does.”

**How the instructor thinks:**
* Teaching quality = personal judgement
* Progress lives in the head, not on paper
* Time is scarce; admin is a burden
* Students panic; firmness is necessary

**What the instructor optimises for:**
* Getting through the day
* Avoiding conflicts
* Keeping schedule moving

**What frustrates the instructor:**
* Cancellations and delays
* Being blamed for fear or failure
* Repeating the same explanations

**Resulting behaviour:**
* Relies on instinct over structure
* Gives verbal, inconsistent feedback
* Resists new tools unless extremely simple

## 3. Driving School Owner Mental Model

**Core belief:**
> “This business survives on reputation, not systems — problems are part of the job.”

**How the owner thinks:**
* Instructors are the bottleneck
* Price competition is unavoidable
* More students = more chaos
* Govt systems are outside control

**What the owner optimises for:**
* Full instructor utilisation
* Steady cash flow
* Avoiding complaints reaching RTO

**What worries the owner:**
* Empty slots
* Bad word of mouth
* Losing students to cheaper schools

**Resulting behaviour:**
* Discounts to close deals
* Firefighting instead of improving systems
* Hesitant to invest in tools

## Key Insight

> Each actor believes *uncertainty is unavoidable* — so they optimise for survival, not excellence.

**Shared belief results:**
* Learners accept confusion
* Instructors rely on instinct
* Owners tolerate chaos

## Design Implication

Any successful product **must fit these mental models first**, then gently reshape them — not fight them.
If the product demands behaviour that contradicts these beliefs too early, adoption will fail.

## Strategic Focus
* **Identify which mental model is easiest to shift first.**
* **Anchor the product’s first value moment there.**
